# Prisoner-s-Dilemma-Spatial-Games-Golang
Previously I have used python to achieve the goal
And in this Repo, I will use Go to make it, also, a gif will be generated to show the transformation of the prison 
Inside needed.zip is the library you need, put them all together with exercise in your go/src 
then in command line with "\exercise.exe f99.txt 1.65 30" you can see the wanted picture
